ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Gjed, an italian hockey player and software developer!
I like playing hockey and being outdoor. But I also love programming and learning new stuff
Right now Iâ€™m currently having fun with a lot of different themes and projects: docker, osservability, devops, funtional testing and more
